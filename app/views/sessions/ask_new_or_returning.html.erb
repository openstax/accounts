<p>Is this your first time making an OpenStax account? If so, choose the option on the right to complete your registration.</p>

<p>If you think you have an existing OpenStax account using a different login, sign in on the left using that login so we can find the existing account and connect all of your logins to it.</p>

<p>If so,
login on the left using the other account and we will link your profiles
