<p>Hi <%= @user.casual_name %>,</p>

<p>Someone just reported that they can't sign in to your OpenStax account.
   If this wasn't you, please ignore this message.</p>

<% if @multiple_users %>
  <p>We are sending an email like this to multiple accounts that all share the email address
     submitted through our account recovery page. This email is specifically for the account
     with username '<b><%= @user.username %></b>'.</p>
<% end %>

<% if @multiple_emails_per_user %>
  <p>We are sending an email like this to all of the addresses attached to the account with
     the username submitted through account recovery page, so you will likely be getting this
     email more than once.  They all contain equivalent information, so you may ignore all
     but one.</p>
<% end %>

<% if @user.identity.present? %>
  <p>You can sign in to your account with a password.  To reset your password, please follow this link:</p>

  <p><%= link_to "Reset your password", reset_password_url(code: @reset_password_code) %></p>
<% else %>
  <p>Your account does not use a password to sign in.</p>

<% social_auths = @user.authentications.reject { |a| a.provider == 'identity' } %>

<% if social_auths.present? %>
  <p>You can <%= 'also ' if @user.identity.present? %>sign in with <%= authentications_list(social_auths) %>:</p>

  <ul>
    <% social_auths.each do |social_auth| %>
      <li><%= link_to "Sign in with #{social_auth.provider.capitalize}", "#{root_url}auth/#{social_auth.provider}" %></li>
