    description <<-EOS
      All actions in this controller operate only on the current user,
      who is determined from the Oauth token.

      All users of OpenStax have an associated User object.
      Admins (for Accounts only) are identified by the is_administrator boolean.
      Some additional user information can be found in associations, such as
      email addresses in ContactInfos and the password hash in Identity.

      Users have the following String attributes:
      username, first_name, last_name, title, suffix

  api :GET, '/users',
            'Returns a set of Users matching query terms'
  description <<-EOS
    Accepts a query string along with options and returns a JSON representation
    of the matching Users. The maximum number of results is limited to
    #{SearchUsers::MAX_MATCHING_USERS}. If this number is exceeded, an empty
    result set will be returned, although the API will still indicate the number
    of matching users. The schema for the returned JSON result is shown below.

  # Using route helpers doesn't work in test or production, probably has to do with initialization order
  example "#{api_example(url_base: 'https://accounts.openstax.org/api/users', url_end: '?q=username:bob%20name=Jones')}"
  param :q, String, required: true, desc: <<-EOS
    The search query string, built up as a space-separated collection of
    search conditions on different fields.  Each condition is formatted as
    "field_name:comma-separated-values".  The resulting list of Users will
    match all of the conditions (boolean 'and').  Each condition will produce
    a list of that must match any of the comma-separated-values (boolean 'or').
    The fields_names and their characteristics are given below.
    When a field is listed as using wildcard matching, it means that any fields
    that start with a comma-separated-value will be matched.

    * `username` &ndash; Matches usernames. (uses wildcard matching)
    * `first_name` &ndash; Matches Users' first names, case insensitive. (uses wildcard matching)
    * `last_name` &ndash; Matches Users' last names, case insensitive. (uses wildcard matching)
    * `name` &ndash; Matches Users' first, last, or full names, case insensitive. (uses wildcard matching)
    * `id` &ndash; Matches Users' IDs exactly.
    * `email` &ndash; Matches Users' emails exactly.

    You can also add search terms without prefixes, separated by spaces.
    These terms  will be searched for in all of the prefix categories.
    Any matching Users will be returned.
    When combined with prefixed search terms, the final result will contain
    Users matching any of the non-prefixed terms and all of the prefixed terms.

    Examples:

    `username:ric` &ndash; returns Users for 'richb' and 'ricardo' Users.

    `username:ric name:"Van Buren"` &ndash; returns the Users for the 'Ricardo Van Buren' User.

    `ric` &ndash; returns Users for 'richb', 'ricardo', and 'Jimmy Rich' Users.
  EOS
  param :order_by, String, desc: <<-EOS
    A string that indicates how to sort the results of the query. The string
    is a comma-separated list of fields with an optional sort direction. The
    sort will be performed in the order the fields are given.
    The fields can be one of #{SearchUsers::SORTABLE_FIELDS.collect{|sf| "`"+sf+"`"}.join(', ')}.
    Sort directions can either be `ASC` for an ascending sort, or `DESC` for a
    descending sort. If not provided, an ascending sort is assumed. Sort directions
    should be separated from the fields by a space. (default: `username ASC`)

    Example:

    `last_name, username DESC` &ndash; sorts by last name ascending, then by username descending

    an user who has not yet completed the sign up process.

    An email address or username must be supplied.

    If the username or email is already in use, that existing user's ID
    will be returned.

    If an account is created with only an email and no username, it cannot be logged
    into directly.  It will merged with the user's account when they complete the
    standard sign up process using a matching email address.

    If an account is created with a username and password, it may be signed into and used
    immediately once the user agress to the Terms and Conditions.
