      All actions in this controller operate only on ApplicationUsers that
      belong to the current application, as determined from the Oauth token.

      ApplicationUsers are automatically created when an app obtains an access token of any kind for a specific user.
      They record which users have authorized (via Oauth) which OpenStax Accounts applications.
      This information is used to filter search results and control application access to user information.

      User preferences for each app that are used by Accounts are also recorded in ApplicationUser.
      Current preferences include default_contact_info_id, the id of the user's default
      contact info object to be used for each particular application.'

  api :GET, '/application_users',
            'Returns a set of ApplicationUsers matching query terms'
  description <<-EOS
    Accepts a query string along with options and returns a JSON representation
    of the matching ApplicationUsers.
    Some User data may be filtered out depending on the
    caller's status and priviledges in the system.
    The schema for the returned JSON result is shown below.

  # Using route helpers doesn't work in test or production, probably has to do with initialization order
  example "#{api_example(url_base: 'https://accounts.openstax.org/api/application_users', url_end: '?q=username:bob%20name=Jones')}"
  param :q, String, required: true, desc: <<-EOS
    The search query string, built up as a space-separated collection of
    search conditions on different fields. Each condition is formatted as
    "field_name:comma-separated-values". The resulting list of ApplicationUsers will
    have Users that match all of the conditions (boolean 'and'). Each condition will produce
    a list of ApplicationUsers whose Users must match any of the comma-separated-values
    (boolean 'or'). The fields_names and their characteristics are given below.
    When a field is listed as using wildcard matching, it means that any fields
    that start with a comma-separated-value will be matched.

    * `username` &ndash; Matches usernames. (uses wildcard matching)
    * `first_name` &ndash; Matches Users' first names, case insensitive. (uses wildcard matching)
    * `last_name` &ndash; Matches Users' last names, case insensitive. (uses wildcard matching)
    * `name` &ndash; Matches Users' first, last, or full names, case insensitive. (uses wildcard matching)
    * `id` &ndash; Matches Users' IDs exactly.
    * `email` &ndash; Matches Users' emails exactly.

    You can also add search terms without prefixes, separated by spaces. These terms  will be searched for
    in all of the prefix categories. Any ApplicationUsers with matching Users will be returned.
    When combined with prefixed search terms, the final results will contain Users matching any of
    the non-prefixed terms and all of the prefixed terms.

    Examples:

    `username:ric` &ndash; returns ApplicationUsers for 'richb' and 'ricardo' Users.

    `username:ric name:"Van Buren"` &ndash; returns the ApplicationUsers for the 'Ricardo Van Buren' User.

    `ric` &ndash; returns ApplicationUsers for 'richb', 'ricardo', and 'Jimmy Rich' Users.
  EOS
  param :page, :number, desc: <<-EOS
    Specifies the page of results to retrieve, zero-indexed. (default: 0)
  EOS
  param :per_page, :number, desc: <<-EOS
    The number of ApplicationUsers to retrieve on the chosen page. (default: 20)
  EOS
  param :order_by, String, desc: <<-EOS
    A string that indicates how to sort the results of the query. The string
    is a comma-separated list of fields with an optional sort direction. The
    sort will be performed in the order the fields are given.
    The fields can be one of #{SearchUsers::SORTABLE_FIELDS.collect{|sf| "`"+sf+"`"}.join(', ')}.
    Sort directions can either be `ASC` for an ascending sort, or `DESC` for a
    descending sort. If not provided, an ascending sort is assumed. Sort directions
    should be separated from the fields by a space. (default: `username ASC`)

    Example:

    `last_name, username DESC` &ndash; sorts by last name ascending, then by username descending

    * `application_users` &ndash; Array containing info about the ApplicationUsers whose updates were read. The "id" and "read_updates" fields are mandatory. "read_updates" should contain the last value for "unread_updates" received by the app.

    Examples:

    Assume your app called `updates` and got an ApplicationUser with id: 42 and unread_updates: 2

    `application_users = {id: 42, read_updates: 2}` &ndash; this is the correct call to `updated`, and marks the ApplicationUser updates as `read` by setting unread_updates to 0.

    Assume your app called `updates` and got an ApplicationUser with id: 13 and unread_updates: 1

    After you called the API and received your response, the user updated their profile in Accounts, setting unread_updates to 2.

    `application_users = {id: 13, read_updates: 1}` &ndash; will not affect the record. The user will be sent again the next time you call `updates`, so you won't miss the updated information.
