  # A User model begins life in the "temp" state, and can then be claimed by another user
  # who originated from an OAuth login. Upon it being claimed it will be removed and it's
  # data merged with the claimant.
  #
  # A User can also be created by a one of the consumer applications as a stand-in
  # for a person who has not yet (or may never) created an account.  In this case
  # the User model will be in the "unclaimed" state.  When the User does signup, they
  # can claim the account and recieve all the permissions and tasks
  # that were assigned to it in the interm.
  #
  # Once a User model is cleared for use, the state is set to "activated"
